# Little Grow - Mobile Development

The MD team developed an Android-based mobile application to implement UI/UX designs. We use firebase as a real-time connection for user authentication. The mobile application development that we carry out is based on the MVVM architecture to separate business logic and application display. The application display implementation that we use is based on Jetpack Composer. In the business logic and back-end part of our application, we use support from the room database using the CRUD API concept.
