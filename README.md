# Little Grow - Mobile Development

Themes: Human Healthcare and Living Wellbeings

Abstract: Our project focuses on addressing the problem of stunting through an innovative mobile application. Stunting, a serious health problem that affects children's growth and development, requires targeted interventions. Our research aims to explore the effectiveness of technology-based approaches in combating stunting. This app will provide good nutritional information and growth tracking. The information or research we get is on the website https://stunting.go.id/. Recognizing the critical need to combat the long-term impact of stunting on children's well-being, our team is motivated to leverage technology to provide broad and accessible solutions, aimed at making a meaningful impact on children's health.

The MD team developed an Android-based mobile application to implement UI/UX designs. We use firebase as a real-time connection for user authentication. The mobile application development that we carry out is based on the MVVM architecture to separate business logic and application display. The application display implementation that we use is based on Jetpack Composer. In the business logic and back-end part of our application, we use support from the room database using the CRUD API concept.
